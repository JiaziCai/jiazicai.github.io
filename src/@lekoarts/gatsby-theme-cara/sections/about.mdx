## About



> I graduated in May 2020 at New York University with a master degree in computer science, and currently looking for full-time opportunities.

> At present I am a Front-end Developer at New York University and have 2-year working experience of React.

I am constantly learning about web technology during my free time by doing new projects. Keep my hands coding!

My favorite tutorial instructor is The Net Ninja. I watched a crazy amount of his videos to get me through my first month of work.
